# ign-pdal-tools

This repo contains various python tools based on [PDAL](https://pdal.io/) that are used to work on
LiDAR data in the [LidarHD](https://www.ign.fr/institut/lidar-hd-vers-une-nouvelle-cartographie-3d-du-territoire)
project at [IGN](https://www.ign.fr) (Institut National de l'Information Géographique et Forestière / French National Institute of
Geographic and Forest Information) to work on LiDAR data.

We've decided to make them available because think that they may be useful to others, but this repo
is NOT meant to be substantially modified from community input, and may be amended/completed depending
on the fonctionalities that our team needs.

# Content

This library contains pdal-based tools to:
* **colorize** a point cloud using images from [Geoplateforme / cartes.gouv.fr](https://www.cartes.gouv.fr/) (a portal
from French government providing access to aerial imagery)
* **stitch** together LAS files using their location
* **standardize** LAS files
* **unlock** LAS files generated by TerraSolid

# Installation / Usage

This library can be used in different ways:
* directly from sources: `make install` creates a mamba environment with the required dependencies
* installed with `pip` from pypi: ` pip install ign-pdal-tools`
* used in a docker container: see documentation [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)

# More details on the contained tools

## Colorization

* [color.py](pdaltools/color.py): Colorize a point cloud from Geoplateforme data

## Las infos

Misc tools to get information on a las file, eg. retrieve metadata, find epsg value, find bounds, get parameters to pass to a writer. They are intended to be used from the pdaltools module, for example:

```python
from pdaltools import las_infos

filename = ...
las_infos.las_info_metadata(filename)
```

## Stitching

* [las_clip.py](pdaltools/las_clip.py): crop a LAS file using 2d bounding box
* [las_merge.py](pdaltools/las_merge.py): merge a LAS file with its neighbors according to their filenames
* [las_add_buffer.py](pdaltools/las_add_buffer.py): add points to a LAS file from a buffer (border) from its neighbors (using filenames to locate neighbors)

**WARNING**: In `las_merge.py` and `las_add_buffer.py`, filenames are used to get the LAS files extents
and to find neighbors.
The naming convention is `{prefix1}_{prefix2}_{xcoord}_{ycoord}_{postfix})}` (eg. `Semis_2021_0770_6278_LA93_IGN69.laz`).
By default, `xcoord` and `ycoord` are given in kilometers and the shape of the tile is 1 km * 1 km

## Standardization

* [standardize_format.py](pdaltools/standardize_format.py): re-write a LAS file in a standard format (see code for details)
* [count_occurences](pdaltools/count_occurences): count occurences for each value of a given attribute in a set of LAS files (initially used for classification)
    * [count_occurences_for_attribute.py](pdaltools/count_occurences/count_occurences_for_attribute.py): count occurences in one or several files and save the result in a json file.
    * [merge_occurences_counts.py](pdaltools/count_occurences/merge_occurences_counts.py): merge counts from several results of [count_occurences_for_attribute](pdaltools/count_occurences/count_occurences_for_attribute.py) (json files) into a single json file (used for parallelization)
* [replace_attribute_in_las.py](test/test_replace_attribute_in_las.py): using a json file containing a correspondance map, replace the occurences of each value in a LAS file by its corresponding value from the map.

## Unlock

[unlock_file.py](pdaltools/unlock_file.py): overwrite a LAS file in case PDAL raises this error:
`readers.las: Global encoding WKT flag not set for point format 6 - 10.` which is due to TerraSolid
malformed LAS output for LAS1.4 files with point format 6 to 10.

# Dev / Build

## Contribute

Every time the code is changed, think of updating the version file: [pdaltools/_version.py](pdaltools/_version.py`)

Please log your changes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

Before committing your changes, run the precommit hooks. They can be installed to run automatically with `make install-precommit`

## Tests

Create the conda environment: `make install`

Run unit tests: `make testing`

## Pip package

To generate a pip package and deploy it on pypi, use the [Makefile](Makefile) at the root of the repo:

* `make build`: build the library
* `make install`: install the library in an editable way (`pip -e`)
* `make deploy` : deploy it on pypi

## Docker image

To build a docker image with the library installed: `make docker-build`

To test the docker image: `make docker-test`
